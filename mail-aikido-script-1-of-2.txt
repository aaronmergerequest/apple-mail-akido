(* Mail Aikido 1.0 Script 1 of 2 *)
(* Move messages into selected folders *)

(* Step 1: Change "mail account name in quotes" to match the human-readable name for the mail account that you want to copy mail into *) 

(* Example myaccount name might be "GMail" or "Work" *)

(* Step 2: Change "target folder in quotes" to match the path and folder you would like to copy mail into *)

(* If your target folder is on the top level of your account, you only need to enter the folder name eg: "Newsletters" *)

(* If your target folder is nested, use forward slashes to traverse the hierarchy eg: "Receipts/2024" *)
